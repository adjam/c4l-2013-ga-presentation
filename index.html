                        Google Analytics can be used to track not only pageviews, but in-page events, allowing you to understand more
                        about how your site is being used.

                		A set of tools within Google Analytics for tracking user actions in a locally customizable, granular way. You decide what to record and how to categorize it. Rather than pushing a javascript call that pushes the standard pageview into Google Analytics for tracking and reporting, you push an event that a user performs on your site, along with several different categories of metadata to describe it -- these can be used for slicing and dicing your reporting later.
						Then you have a Google Analytic's standard, pretty feature-full interface for reporting across these events.

						<h2>Interesting Findings</h2>

						<aside class="notes">It's a little out of scope for this short presentation to share all of our statistics, but I wanted to pick out some interesting and/or surprising things to share. I can make more complete statistics available to those who might be interested. </aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Whoa....look at those tabs.</h5>
						<a class="image"  href="images/catalog-event-categories.png" target="_blank">
                            <img  src="images/catalog-event-categories.png" alt="Full Record Preview" />
                        </a>
                        <small>Note: February 5-7, 2013</small>
                        <aside class="notes">A note about the dates....we just finally got some code released last week that contributed numbers for several categories of activity, particularly
                        	full text URLs and things on the results list. In order to include that activity, I've had to limit the date range for these overall statistics. As I'll note on the next slide, that may skew things a little, but overall the trends
                        	are very similar when compared out across the last 3-4 months.
                        	This chart shows the different categories of events we're tracking - the first level of metadata we use to aggregate our events for reporting.
                        	The first biggest thing you see when looking at the stats is...wow, tabs are used a lot. These are tabs on the full record page. I'll talk about that a little more next slide.
                        	The next thing is that URL category. Note that full text activity is scattered across URL, Location Tab, and Results. It's a big reason that the URL category is so high. </aside>
                    </section>
					<section>
						<h5>Wait...do I see MARC??</h5>
						<a class="image"  href="images/catalog-specific-events.png" target="_blank">
                            <img  src="images/catalog-specific-events.png" alt="Full Record Preview" />
                        </a>
                        <small>Note: February 5-7, 2013</small>
                        <aside class="notes">This data is our second level "actions" -- primarily specific events rather than groupings of events. Again note the prominence of
                        	tab activity here. We saw this confirmed in usability testing recently -- the users literally run through and click on all the tabs  as one of their first activities if they are looking for something. This includes the MARC tab that we thought no one but staff ever clicked on, although they don't stay there very long.
                        	I'm also interested in the number of clicks on the "Details" tab. It's the second tab in our interface, and really, things like ISBN, other authors, other titles, notes are just not what most undergraduates are
                        	looking for. I believe this is another case in point of tab click mania. And then you see Location Tab in the list -- this is them clicking back on the original tab after realizing the other
                        	tabs really weren't particularly helpful. Full text is high obviously; you can see that our list feature is used a fair amount, as is requesting. It's also interesting to see
                        	the Browse shelf, and our feature to send the search out to our local TRLN consortium being relatively highly used in comparison with other things like emailing, printing, or texting a record.</section>

                        <aside class="notes">Now that we've looked at the most popular, what other interesting tidbits have we found?
                        Note we have longer term statistics here, so I feel pretty confident about these numbers. 3/4 of users click on "Browse shelf" from the list of individual items
                        on the holdings tab, rather than the big fancy looking widget.</aside>

                            To track an event of a given type,  you need a <em>category</em> and an <em>action</em>.  Optionally, you can add a <em>label</em> and, if you add the label, you may also add a <em>value</em>.  Picking values for these things (and whether you use 2, 3, or 4 of them for any given event) is up to you.

                        <p><code>data-*</code> attributes give you a place to put data for use by your scripts.  Browsers shouldn't try to do anything with them, and you 
                            probably shouldn't
                            use them to add visual styles.

                            <code>data-*</code> attribute names must be lower case and may contain dashes as separators.  The <code>data-</code> prefix is stripped and the rest is converted to camel case when you access them in your scripts.  
                        </p>
                        <p>e.g. a <code>data-foo-bar</code> attribute in HTML is accessed under the name
                        <code>fooBar</code> in a script.

                        can keep you from just collecting some really boring anecdotes.

                            <p>We are tracking some events sent when users click on content that is loaded externally.</p>

                                <li>You may not control the markup</li>
                                <li>The tracked elements are not in the DOM when the page is loaded, so you have to do a bit more work in your selectors</li>

                        <h2>AJAX Content Tracking (cont.)</h2>
                        <p>jQuery lets you specify handlers for events for elements that don't exist yet, by (essentially) listening on an (existing) element that (will) contain them.  This is not the only approach, but is the easiest to work with.
                    </p>
                        <pre>
                                <code contenteditable>
// our catalog loads transformed EAD XML via XHR when users click on the content tab
$("#contents").on("click", ".EAD_daolink", function(evt) {
    logGAEvent($(this), ['URL','Digitized Content','CCC']);
});
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        <aside class="notes">
                        An alternate approach is to chain an event handler that attaches the events after the content is loaded.  This works, but it's more code and, "yo dawg" and all that.

                            <li><code>*[data-ga-event]</code> matches all elements with tracking data, but is potentially very slow; the data we are collecting can be valuable, 
                                but you don't want to frustrate your users trying to get it.</li>
                            <li>If you use a CSS class in concert with it (e.g. <code>.tracked[data-ga-event]</code>, it's both faster and you can temporarily disable 
                                tracking for some elements should you need to, by simply removing the class.</li>

                        <p>In usability studies, I noticed some people cycle through the tabs; so now we track each element once per page view.  Whether you want to do this depends on your goals.
                        </p>
                        <p>What are patrons doing before they click your chat button?  You could track different events for those kinds of cases if you maintain state locally.

                            jQuery's Data API can be used to write data onto elements.
